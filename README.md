NSC2KE is a Finite-Volume Galerkin program computing 2D and axisymmetric flows on unstructured meshes written by Bijan Mohammadi. To solve the Euler part of the equations, a Roe, an Osher and a Kinetic solvers are available. To compute turbulent flows a k-epsilon model is available. Near-wall turbulence is computed either by wall-laws or by a two-layer approach. Time dependant problems can also be considered as a fourth order Runge-Kutta solver has been used.
